# 3d Angst.

This is the beginning of the extension of what I leared building out [digithink.com](https://www.digithink.som/) site into something more personal. The idea is to extend the [bartender](https://bartender.digithink.som/) to serve this sitd along with my other static websites (killing the ubuntu container in the process). It will use the same tools and mechanism as digithink.com (push content to a git server, use a webhook to pull the content to the web host and build it using mkdocs)

### [Germany/Spain December 2024](/Travel/Germany-Spain-DEC24/)

Shirley, Heide, and I spent 2 weeks in Europe. Aside from the DVT I got on the plane, it was awesome.

I used a disposable linux system as my daily driver for this trip  I am looking at seriously rethinking my commitment to apple products as they become more and more like microsoft and google and less like the industry leaders they were before.
