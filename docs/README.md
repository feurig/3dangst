# 3d Angst.
This is the beginning of the extension of what I leared building out the [digithink.com](https://www.digithink.som/) site so something more personal. The idea is to extend the [bartender](https://bartender.digithink.som/) to serve this sight along with my other static websites (killing the ubuntu container in the process). It will use the same tools and mechanism as digithi.com (push content to a git server, use a webhook to pull the content to the web host and build it using mkdocs)

I am also using a disposable linux system as my daily driver for this so I am looking at seriously rethinking my commitment to apple products as they become more and more like microsoft and google and less like the industry leaders the were before.
