#### Monday
Went do a doctor who diagnosed me with Deep Vein Thrombosis, Am supposed to be on blood thinners for a month or so.
The whole thing cost less than 200Euros with no insurance. 
In the states that would have been my out of pocket after insurance.
Our last day was spent checking out Tram68. It was dark.
