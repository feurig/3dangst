Also I need to find/make  a decent recording of boise.

Boise.

In a hotel in boise.
We’re drinking with Small Ball Paul
And Cher UK after a pretty good show.
Maurine she took some twink in the bathroom
After mike took the girls away.
You're making out with Jessy 
I guess anything goes.

Chorus 1:
You threw us under the bus out in Boise.
With your open relationshit but you weren’t alone.
I turned to Jeff and  I said  "how does that work?"
And Jeffery says "Hey man mostly it don’t."

It’s a new day rising and we’re still in Boise.
Let’s go have a drink and a meal for the road.

You know that third bottle was never a good idea.
But your dad paid the amex so we never said no.

Chorus 2:
Taking that 2 hour drive into Boise.
For dinner and drinks and to go see a show.
You punched me out with my hands on  the wheel.
Spinning into the ditch screaming out of control.

Bridge.

Chorus 3:
Taking that 2 hour drive into Boise.
For dinner and drinks and to go see a show.
You punched me out with my hands on  the wheel.
Screaming into the ditch spinning out of control.

## not that bad

Not that bad.

You were right. And I'm Sorry.
I know hind sight is purfect but that wasn't bad.
Things we come to regret most in life take a moment.
Once that moment is gone well you can't take it back.

You picked me up at the Middle East.
And took me to after hours clubs till 5 am
When I told you that I couldn't sleep with you
You just laughed at me then you paid for the cab.

Then your shower curtain collaped all around me.
Found myself in a laughing pile in your tiny bed.
You were sweet, we were safe, and you found me.
I know hindsight is perfect but that wasn't bad

There it was. My last night in boston.
And I'd committed myself to a long distant failure.
Case and point I couldn't even get out of town
What a fool. I'd already blown it.

When I woke in that strange little bed out in south-e 
With a hangover as deep as my guilt and south loathing
When you looked in my eyes you saw deep disappointment
Kind of broke my heart when you said hey was it that bad?

[bridge]
Things we come to regret most in life take a moment
And once that moment is gone well we cant take it back.
So it seems that the best we can do is to own it.
And to say that you were right and I'm sorry. Cause that wasnt bad.


## buzz.

Buzz.

I'm late for work. 
Wish I'd never left the bed.
Got my suit and tie on. 
Then I hear that sound again.
And you know 20 minutes later.
Well I'm still fooling around. 

When I head out the door.
I take a final look around. 
[chorus]
And woudln't you know in the other room
Callin soft and low. 
And I tell myself
Just a little more. 
I feel her pulling me
Like an undertow. 
That irresistible buzz.

I'm later still. Well I should just go back to bed.
Cause my work closthes are drenched
And that buzzing fills my head.
So I call up the girls.
Tell them I'm out sick today.
Yeah I know I got bills.
Fuck that I'm going to sit and play.

[chorus]
Cause you know in the other room
Callin soft and low. 
And I tell myself
Just a little more. 
I feel her pulling me
Like an undertow. 
That irresistible buzz.

That irresistable buzz.

[chorus]
And woudln't you know in the other room
Callin soft and low. 
And I tell myself
Just a little more. 
Another morning lost
In the afterglow 
Of hat irresistible buzz.

## Rumble/Dreck
Rumble/Dreck:

We keep coming to this place again
And I'm hoping that the stench will end
Destroying the unity.
Of our punk rock community.

But when the sieg heils went out in the pit
they met skateboards, boots and bloodied fists.
Taken out like so much Nazi trash.

We keep coming to this place again
And I'm doubting that the stench will end
Destroying the flavor
Good german food on the table

But uncle bills going on about the spics 
and faules swartzer until i slam my fists
On the table "HAU VEG DEN NAZI DRECK"

We keep coming to this place again
And the stench is never gonna end
Defiling the border
Between Justice and Order.

When whites need food but blacks are looters
And target practice for uniformed sharpshooters
And it just keep coming back again 
from the state our family and friends
Won't someone please just take out the trash.
